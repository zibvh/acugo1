# Bixcart

A student marketplace for Ajayi Crowther University (and built to extend to other campuses). Started as a classifieds-style app — post an item, message the seller, meet up to exchange it. It's moving toward a real online store: browse, add to cart, pay online, get it delivered. Meeting up in person is still there as a fallback for sellers/buyers who prefer it.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Mongoose)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no build step
- **Auth**: JWT + bcrypt, email verification (any valid email address)
- **Images**: Cloudinary (upload) + Multer (handling)
- **Payments**: Paystack (checkout, escrow refunds, and seller payouts after escrow release)
- **Email**: Brevo API (verification, password reset)
- **Push**: Web Push (VAPID)
- **AI moderation**: Gemini, flags listings/conversations for admin review
- **Icons**: Lucide-style inline SVG, no dependency
- **Fonts**: Fredoka, Raleway, Nunito (Google Fonts)

## Quick Start

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create `backend/.env` (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) below — at minimum you need `MONGODB_URI` and `JWT_SECRET` to boot).

```bash
node server.js
# → http://localhost:3001
```

The server serves the frontend too — no separate frontend process needed.

No demo data ships with the app (that only existed back when this ran on an embedded NeDB store). Register a normal account through the UI, or create an admin account:

```bash
cd backend
npm run create-admin
```

## Environment Variables (`backend/.env`)

```bash
# Required to boot
MONGODB_URI=            # MongoDB Atlas (or any Mongo) connection string
JWT_SECRET=              # random string, used to sign auth tokens
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development

# Payments (Paystack) — checkout and seller credit purchases won't work without these
PAYSTACK_PUBLIC_KEY=
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=

# Image upload
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=

# Email (Brevo API — verification + password reset)
BREVO_API_KEY=
EMAIL_FROM=

# Push notifications (generate with: npx web-push generate-vapid-keys)
VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=
VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=
VAPID_EMAIL=

# AI moderation
GEMINI_API_KEY=

# create-admin script
ADMIN_EMAIL=
ADMIN_PASSWORD=
ADMIN_NAME=

# CORS / links in emails
FRONTEND_URL=
```

Anything left blank just disables that feature gracefully (e.g. no `GEMINI_API_KEY` means listings skip AI moderation) — except `MONGODB_URI` and `JWT_SECRET`, which the server needs to start at all.

## How buying works

1. Buyer adds one or more listings to their **cart** (quick-add from the marketplace grid, or from the listing page).
2. At **checkout**, they enter a delivery address and pay the full cart total through Paystack (card, transfer, or USSD).
3. Payment is verified server-side against Paystack before anything is created — the app never trusts a client-reported "success." If the cart spans multiple sellers, checkout splits into one order per seller, all tagged with the same `checkout_group` so the buyer sees it as one purchase.
4. Each seller sees their incoming orders under **Seller Dashboard → Orders**, with the buyer's delivery details. They accept or decline, then mark the order delivered once it's out.
5. The buyer marks it received on their end; once both sides confirm, the order is complete and the buyer can rate the seller.

The older path — message a seller directly, negotiate, agree to meet up in person — still works and shows up under **Seller Dashboard → Transactions**. Nothing about it changed; cart checkout was added alongside it, not in place of it.

## Current marketplace business model

- Product listings are **free**. There is no payment per listing and no listing-credit purchase requirement.
- Listings remain active for the configured listing period (currently 3 months / the applicable semester model) and can be renewed without a listing fee.
- Bixcart earns a commission only from successfully completed marketplace sales.
- Seller commission starts at **7%** and can permanently decrease through successful-sale tiers down to a **5.5% floor**.
- Buyer payments are held in Bixcart's escrow workflow. Seller payout is not released at checkout.
- If an order is declined, cancelled, or automatically cancelled because a seller misses the response/delivery deadline, Bixcart initiates a refund and notifies the buyer.
- When escrow is successfully released, the seller's entitlement is paid to the seller's verified Paystack payout recipient. Bixcart and the seller share the applicable Paystack processing fee.
- Sellers must be approved by an admin before seller functionality is enabled.
- Sellers must choose **exactly one** location mode: hostel (hostel + room) **or** shop (shop name/number/address). They cannot use both at the same time.

## Production Notes

- Set every key in [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) — the app degrades feature-by-feature if one's missing, but checkout specifically needs `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` to verify payments.
- `JWT_SECRET` should be a long random string in production (Render's blueprint auto-generates one — see `render.yaml`).
- Rate limiting (`express-rate-limit`) is already a dependency — confirm it's applied to the routes that need it (auth, checkout) before going live.
- See `DEPLOY.md` for the full deployment walkthrough.
